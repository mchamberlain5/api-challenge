The trends I notested in the weather.py was that distance from the equator or latitude had a strong correllation with max temperature. 
This applied for both the northern and southern hemisphere. As latitude increased in eather direction, max temperature decreased. 
I also noticed that there was less of a correllation between latitude and cloudiness. 
I also noticed that there was less of a correllation between latitude and windiness.
